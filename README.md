## Overview

An NFT card, or Non-Fungible Token card, is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. NFTs are cryptographic tokens that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item or piece of content, in this case, a card. I have created this version of the NFT card with the specifications from the website FrontEnd Mentor in hopes to practice and improve my frontend styling skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### HTML Structure

I began this project by creating HTML structure for the content of the NFT card. This structure provided a "skeleton" for the design of the implmementation to take form. I began defining the layout, sections, and elements that make up the card, such as the title, image contianer, creator details, and metadata. 

### CSS Styles

I then began styling the CSS accordingly to enhance the visual appeal of the card. This was done by applying formatting, colors, fonts, and positioning to achieve the desired look. 

### Javascript

There was limited functionality in this component so the JavaScript was little to none, but I did have to add some for the functionality of the card image's hover function.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To use the tools and structures I have learned in the past to create a cool card component that will be reusable in the near future for other endeavors!

### Continued development

I want to focus on how I can limit the amount of classes I have on a component in the future.

### Useful resources

- [MDN]( - This helped me better understand what I needed to do for the hover functionality in the JavaScript code.
